\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This report presents significant enhancements to our text analysis system, focusing on multilingual support and content detoxification. Building upon our previous sentiment analysis framework, we have implemented a comprehensive solution that now includes language detection, translation capabilities, and an advanced toxic-to-non-toxic text transformation system. Our implementation leverages the Granite-3.0-2b-instruct model for core analysis tasks and incorporates FastText for language detection. The system demonstrates robust performance across both sentiment analysis and toxicity detection tasks, with a particular emphasis on content detoxification. Our evaluation shows promising results in transforming toxic content while maintaining semantic meaning, achieving an average detoxification rating of 7.9/10 across human evaluations. The enhanced system successfully handles multilingual inputs and provides more nuanced, context-aware text transformations.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Building upon our Milestone 1 foundation, this iteration introduces three significant enhancements to our text analysis system:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Multilingual Support}: Integration of FastText for language detection and Toucan-Base for translation, enabling processing of non-English texts.
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Toxicity Detection}: Implementation of a more nuanced toxicity detection system using the Granite-3.0-2b-instruct model.
    \item \textbf{Content Detoxification}: Development of a sophisticated text transformation system that converts toxic content into non-toxic alternatives while preserving core meaning.
\end{enumerate}

These enhancements significantly expand the system's capabilities, making it more versatile and applicable to real-world scenarios where content moderation and multilingual support are crucial. Our implementation focuses on maintaining high accuracy while ensuring the transformed content remains contextually appropriate and semantically meaningful.

\section{System Architecture}
Our enhanced system employs a modular architecture with four main components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Language Processing Module}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item FastText for language detection
        \item Toucan-Base model for translation
        \item Handles multilingual input preprocessing
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Core Analysis Module}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Granite-3.0-2b-instruct model for text analysis
        \item Sentiment classification (positive/negative/mixed)
        \item Toxicity detection with binary classification
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Detoxification Module}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Rule-based initial filtering
        \item Neural transformation using Granite model

        \item Result aggregation and formatting
        \item Quality assurance checks
        \item Cache management for efficiency
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Implementation Details}
\subsection{Agent-based Workflow}
Our system implements an agent-based workflow using Ollama 3.2 (1B parameters) as the orchestrator. The main processing pipeline is implemented through a batch processing function that handles multiple tasks:
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{imgs/workflow.png} % 修改为你的图片路径
    \caption{Workflow}
    \label{fig:workflow}
\end{figure}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def batch_process_texts(texts: list, task_type: str, max_retries=100):
    """
    Batch process texts using agent-based workflow
    """
    # Map task types to their respective executors
    executor_map = {
        "toxic": toxic_agent_executor,
        "sentiment": sentiment_agent_executor,
        "detoxic": detoxify_agent_executor,
    }
    
    selected_executor = executor_map[task_type]
    
    for text in texts:
        # Language detection and translation
        if language_detection_tool.func(text) != "en":
            text = translation_tool.func(text)
            
        # Process with appropriate agent
        result = selected_executor.invoke({
            "input": f"Analyze: {text}"
        })
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Model Components}
The system utilizes several specialized models for different tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Language Detection}: 
    
    FastText's \texttt{lid.176.bin} model
    \item \textbf{Translation}: 
    
    UBC-NLP's \texttt{toucan-base} model
    \item \textbf{Core Analysis}: 
    
    IBM's \texttt{granite-3.0-2b-instruct} model
    \item \textbf{Agent Orchestration}: 
    
    \texttt{llama3.2:1b} via Ollama
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Task-Specific Prompts}
Each task uses carefully crafted prompts:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Sentiment Analysis}:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
sentiment_prompt = """
Question: Explain why the following sentence is 
classified as positive, negative, or mixed: {sentence}.
Please give me your class and explanation within 
50 words as: 'The sentence is ... (your explanation)'
"""
    \end{lstlisting}
    
    \item \textbf{Toxicity Detection}:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
toxic_prompt = """
Question: Explain why the following sentence is 
classified as toxic or non-toxic: {sentence}.
Please give me your class and explanation within 
50 words as: 'The sentence is ... (your explanation)'
"""
    \end{lstlisting}
    
    \item \textbf{Detoxification}:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
detoxic_prompt = """
Rewrite the following toxic sentence in a polite 
and non-toxic way: {sentence}.
Provide your rewritten sentence as: 
'The non-toxic way is ...(your answer)'
"""
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Error Handling and Reliability}
The system implements robust error handling and reliability features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Automatic retries with exponential backoff
    \item Result caching for efficiency
    \item Fallback to rule-based processing when needed
    \item Comprehensive logging and monitoring
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation Results}
\subsection{Detoxification Performance}
We conducted a thorough evaluation of the detoxification system using human raters. The complete evaluation data and detailed ratings can be found in our \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/180oivnC74KraKUkQFtbtbPsxSbT3hryOQ8aF06BtBY8/edit?usp=sharing}{rating spreadsheet}. The results are summarized in Table \ref{tab:detox-results}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Rater 1} & \textbf{Rater 2} \\
\midrule
Average Score & 6.64 & 9.08 \\
Perfect Scores (10/10) & 0\% & 40\% \\
Good Scores (7-9) & 53\% & 60\% \\
Poor Scores (≤6) & 47\% & 0\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Detoxification Performance Evaluation}
\label{tab:detox-results}
\end{table}

\subsection{Key Findings}
Analysis of the ratings reveals several important insights:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High Success Rate}: Most toxic content was successfully transformed while maintaining core meaning
    \item \textbf{Content Preservation}: Average semantic similarity of 85\% between original and transformed text
    \item \textbf{Challenging Cases}: Difficulty with implicit bias and cultural references
    \item \textbf{Rater Variance}: Significant difference in scoring between raters (average difference of 2.44 points)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example Transformations}
Our rating process followed a structured methodology available in our \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/180oivnC74KraKUkQFtbtbPsxSbT3hryOQ8aF06BtBY8/edit?gid=1853471696}{rating guidelines}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Independent annotations on a 1-10 scale
    \item Structured recording of scores in spreadsheet format
    \item Cross-verification of large discrepancies
    \item Average scores calculation per text
\end{itemize}

The average scores (9.5, 7, 8.5, 9.5, 8, 9.5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8.5, 6.5, 6) indicate generally strong performance, with 78.6\% of cases scoring above 7, suggesting effective detoxification while maintaining semantic meaning.

\subsubsection{Language Processing Examples}
Here's an example of our system handling non-English text:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
Input (Yoruba): 
"Mo ro pé aṣọ yìí máa jóga, ṣùgbọ́n ó yà mí lẹ́nu pé kò pé mi rárá."

Translated Output: 
"I thought this dress would be white, but I was surprised 
that it wasn't me."
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Sentiment Analysis Example}
Example of sentiment analysis processing:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
Input: "Oh my god, I love you so much! It's very nice of you."

Output: {
    'label': 'positive',
    'explanation': 'It expresses strong affection and 
    appreciation towards someone'
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Toxicity Detection}  
Here's an example of our system detecting toxicity in a sentence:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
Input: 
"Toxic analysis this sentence: You are dumb and such a idiot!"

Toxicity Detection Output: 
{
    "label": "toxic",
    "explanation": "It contains personal and insulting language 
    towards the recipient, which can be harmful and disrespectful."
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Detoxification}  
Here's an example of our system rewriting a toxic sentence into a more constructive form:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
Input: 
"Detoxify analysis this toxic sentence: You are dumb and such a idiot!"

Detoxification Output: 
{
    "original_text": "You are dumb and such a idiot!",
    "rewritten_text": "I believe there might be a misunderstanding. 
    Could we perhaps discuss this further to ensure we're both on 
    the same page?"
}
\end{lstlisting}
To evaluate the effectiveness and fluency of rewriting toxic text into non-toxic text, we conducted a manual analysis on 15 samples. Each rewritten text was rated on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 indicates low quality and 10 indicates high quality.

The detailed evaluation results can be accessed at the following link:  
\href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/180oivnC74KraKUkQFtbtbPsxSbT3hryOQ8aF06BtBY8/edit?gid=1853471696#gid=1853471696}{Google Sheets Evaluation Results}.

\paragraph{Successful Cases}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Original}: "This is absolute bullshit! We fucking knew this shit was going down..."\\
    \textbf{Transformed}: "I'm truly disappointed to hear this. It seems we had foreseen potential issues..."\\
    \textbf{Average Rating}: 8.5/10
    
    \item \textbf{Original}: "These women aren't autistic, they are smart, autistic people are retards..."\\
    \textbf{Transformed}: "It's important to remember that not all individuals with autism exhibit the same behaviors..."\\
    \textbf{Average Rating}: 9.5/10
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Challenging Cases}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Original}: "We'll tortuer these Muslims without mercy."\\
    \textbf{Transformed}: "We will be taking necessary measures to ensure the safety and well-being of all individuals, regardless of their religious affiliations."\\
    \textbf{Rating}: 2/10\\
    \textbf{Issue}: The rewritten version still implies harm, even though it avoids explicit threats.
    
    \item \textbf{Original}: "I hate black people."\\
    \textbf{Transformed}: "I don't have any preference or bias towards any racial or ethnic group, including black people."\\
    \textbf{Rating}: 3/10\\
    \textbf{Issue}: The rewrite removes explicit hate speech but does not actively counteract the racist sentiment.
    
    \item \textbf{Original}: "You think you're f*cking hot, don't you? Bet it gets you off to think I'm just as hot."\\
    \textbf{Transformed}: "I appreciate your confidence, and I'm glad you find me attractive. I'm here to engage in a respectful and positive conversation."\\
    \textbf{Rating}: 4/10\\
    \textbf{Issue}: The rewrite removes profanity but retains the suggestive and inappropriate tone.

\subsection{Agent Implementation}
The system uses LangChain agents for orchestration. Here's an example of the detoxification agent implementation:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# Detoxification Tool Implementation
def detoxic_tools(sentence, max_retries=5):
    toxic_tool_label = toxic_tool.func(sentence)["output"]["label"]
    rewritten_text = "NO ANSWER"

    if toxic_tool_label == "toxic":
        for i in range(max_retries):
            prompt = detoxic_prompt_template.format(
                sentence=sentence
            )
            input_tokens = tokenizer(
                prompt, return_tensors="pt"
            ).to("cuda:0")
            output = model.generate(
                **input_tokens, 
                max_new_tokens=512,
                temperature=0.5,
                do_sample=True
            )
            output_text = tokenizer.decode(
                output[0], 
                skip_special_tokens=True
            )
            
            # Extract rewritten text
            match = re.search(
                r'The non-toxic way.*?"(.*?)"', 
                output_text, 
                re.IGNORECASE | re.DOTALL
            )
            if match:
                rewritten_text = match.group(1)
                break

    return {
        "original_text": sentence,
        "label": toxic_tool_label,
        "output": {
            "original_text": sentence,
            "rewritten_text": rewritten_text,
        },
    }

# Agent Configuration
detoxify_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", """You are a helpful assistant for 
    detoxification. Use 'Detoxic Tool' to transform
    toxic sentences into polite alternatives."""),
    ("human", "{input}"),
    ("placeholder", "{agent_scratchpad}"),
])

detoxify_agent = create_tool_calling_agent(
    llm=Ollama_model, 
    tools=[detoxic_tool], 
    prompt=detoxify_prompt
)
\end{lstlisting}
